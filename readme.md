# New York Times Search Page

The New York Times Search (NYTS) Page is a small project created to allow a user to quickly search through the New York Times' article database dating back to 1851. A person can use it to search current topics they're interested in or to perform historical research.

The website uses the New York Times API in order to access their database.
